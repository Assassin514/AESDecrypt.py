Ill improve it visually over time you can add more secuirty features as you please
first iteration of this code was made in C++ from here:https://gist.github.com/irbull/c76a8c60e049a9fcba1116aa81771253#file-aes-decryption-cpp
I then used ChatGPT to convert to python cause why not( i do not know C++ or Python). And i proceeded to add text boxes and various validations that work for 128 bit encrptions
